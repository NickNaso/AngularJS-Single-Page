# AngularJS-Single-Page
This is a single page app that uses AngularJS on the front end and some PHP form validation on the backend. This was really fun to build and I learned a lot in the proccess. 

I'm going to add some screen shots of the website and do a walk through here on the README. It will give you a taste of what the website looks like and I'll explain some of the features that don't work here on github's live demo pages (like the php form validation). Hopefully in the future I will set up a dedicated site to host my repositories so you all can interact with them and test them before pulling the code. 

*** Current working on the website walkthrough and screenshots... Stay tuned!! ***
