# AngularJS-Single-Page
This is a single page app that uses AngularJS on the front end and a little bit of php form validation on the backend. This was really fun to build and I learned a lot in the proccess. 

I'm going to add some screen shots of the website since I haven't had a chance to host it and the live demo here on github doensn't show the PHP backend working to validate the form inputs (which is the star feature!!). 

*** Working on the website walkthrough and screenshots... Stay tuned ***
